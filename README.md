Name: BeautyProductsSQL

Tools: SQL Server Management Studio

I am creating a database to keep track of the products that I use, such as hair, body, makeup, and face prducts. This database will help me to determine how much I like a product, how often I will need to buy this product, and the brand I enjoy using the most. This project is allowing me to explore SQL Server through the UI and T-SQL commands.
