Name: BeautyProductsSQL

I am creating a database to keep track of the products that I use, such as hair, body, makeup, and face prducts. This database will help me to determine how much I like a product, how often I will need to buy this product, and the brand I enjoy using the most. 

The tables that I have created are a hair, body, makeup, face, and usage. These break down the type of beauty products that I use in 4 major categories.

I will be using SQL in SQL Server Management Studio.
